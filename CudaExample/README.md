// Invert Image
The goal of this program is to take in images and invert the rgb colors

You specify the number of threads and the location of the image folder

the images in the folder need to all have the same dimensions
4000k, 1080, 720 etc.

requires opencv to run

In case whoever is grading this has a hard time setting it up
I will inlcude the exe and dll in the github
